<div class="text" id="text1">what passing-bells for these who die as cattle?
    only the monstrous anger of the guns.
    only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle
    can patter out their hasty orisons</div>
<div class="text" id="text2">it came today to visit
    and moved into the house
    it was smaller than an elephant
    but larger than a mouse</div>
<div class="text" id="text3">go ahead and praise your ear-****** demons then,
    while I lay to rest under the waters with my sirens
    drowning out all the noise you made in my life</div>
